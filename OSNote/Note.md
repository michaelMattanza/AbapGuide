# Installing SAP Notes

To install SAP Notes, you should access the system in English. It's also recommended to use a supporting Excel file.

Once you have the list of notes to install, launch transaction *SNOTE* and follow these steps:

* Mark the note to be installed on your Excel sheet.
* Check that it's compatible with the system you're installing it on.
* Check for any prerequisites; if needed, install them before the main note.
* Check for any manual activities required (pre-implementation or post-implementation).
* Proceed with the note installation.

**Note:**
Some prerequisites or manual activities are specified at the beginning of the note's documentation. Read the document carefully before proceeding with the installation.
