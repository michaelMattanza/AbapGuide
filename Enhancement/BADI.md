**BAdI**

BAdIs (Business ADD-INs) are OO classes where it is possible to add custom code, in appropriate methods, which are called by standard code. The main characteristic of a BAdI is that it provides a mechanism to modify the functionality of a well-defined business function (e.g., a BAPI) without making changes to the source code.

To create your own implementation, use transaction *SE18*.
